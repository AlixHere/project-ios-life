What is the APP Concept: 

This iOS app is designed to teach the young audience on life skills through a series of pre-defined scenarios in the structure of adventure games such as time management, courtesy, budgeting, bullying, etc.

THis demo showcases an important lesson on time management, a skill not all adolescents are able to learn effectively. Through this short story, users learn the impact of each action and its inherent consequences leading to a range of outcomes. These outcomes stem from the users combination of decisions, in which at the end, the user is greeted with tips and advice on learning that skill.
Thereare other larger and more prominent real world problems we intend to mentor kids through such stories include cyber bullying, mental health, etc.

Why use this app?
Similar to brain training apps, this app is similarly designed to facilitate in the learning of users in important skills, however is targeted towards a younger adolescent audience in problems they typically will or may experience.  

Why would kids be bothered to use this app?
It's a unique and more engaging way of getting kids more engaged in the learning process and being actievly aware of how to handle such real problems they encounter during their teenage life. Identical to doing a brain training game or completing a certain task at the beginning of each morning to be productive, this app gets users to play through a short story to get them to learn. An interactive learning app, essentially a story based game for more visual enticement rather than a database of information to relay to kids. 

Why kids?
Kids were the demographic as there are many apps that assist adults with their current problems, however there are limited resources in centralising and teaching kids skills in a fun quick way. Education in schools does not address these issues thoroughly, thats why this app further assist kids who want to learn more on their own. 

Design:
The deisgn is intended for each topic to have multiple options and pathways to have various outcomes. The design is to use limited viewcontrollers to ensure high performance, however for this demo, multiple view controllers are used to showcase the story flow. 



The user will go through a scenario and will choose one out of the 3 options presented as to what they would do in the situation.

At the end of the scenario, the user will be presented with what the outcome is in the result of their choices/actions.

Score based?
